# react_todo
### This app is my personal project created with React+Redux (using styles naming according to BEM metodology).
The app's design follows microsoft todo list app (but with less functionality).  
Application is adapted for mobile devices and available here: https://alextogar.github.io/react_todo/
### Functionality:
- create/delete/select a category;
- create/delete/edit a task;
- switch theme (dark or light);
- mark a task as important;
- complete the task;
- restore task;
- show/hide the list of completed tasks.
