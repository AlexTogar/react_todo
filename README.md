# react_todo
### This app is my personal project created with Reactjs (using styles naming according to BEM metodology).
The app's design follows microsoft todo list app (but with less functionality).  
Application is adapted for mobile devices and available here: https://alextogar.github.io/react_todo/
### Functionality:
- create/delete/select a category;
- create/delete/edit a task;
- switch theme (dark or light);
- mark a task as important;
- complete the task;
- restore task;
- show/hide the list of completed tasks.
